# Reproducible environments

## Setting up docker, taking notes.

- Using [this](https://docs.docker.com/install/linux/docker-ce/ubuntu/#install-docker-ce)
- According to that step 1 is setting up a docker repository. Following the instructions for that.
  - Run `sudo apt-get update`
  - Run
    ```
    sudo apt-get install \
    apt-transport-https \
    ca-certificates \
    curl \
    gnupg-agent \
    software-properties-common
    ```
   - Add GPG key using `curl -fsSL https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu/gpg | sudo apt-key add -`
   - Verify that's worked by running `sudo apt-key fingerprint 0EBFCD88` and checking the output against the model output they give which is
     ```   
     pub   4096R/0EBFCD88 2017-02-22
           Key fingerprint = 9DC8 5822 9FC7 DD38 854A  E2D8 8D81 803C 0EBF CD88
     uid                  Docker Release (CE deb) <docker@docker.com>
     sub   4096R/F273FCD8 2017-02-22
     ```
   - Use `lsb_release -cs` to check my ubuntu distribution, found it's xenial. Don't appear to do anything with the info but it was in the instructions.
   - Run
     ```
     sudo add-apt-repository \
     "deb [arch=amd64] https://download.docker.com/linux/ubuntu \
     $(lsb_release -cs) \
     stable"
     ```
   - Run `sudo apt-get update` again.rjarnold/learning_docker:first_image_online
   - Install docker by `sudo apt-get install docker-ce`
   - Ran `sudo docker run hello-world`, it downloaded something automatically and then came up with a message saying hello and indicating the installation had been sucessful.
     ```
     Hello from Docker!
     This message shows that your installation appears to be working correctly.

     To generate this message, Docker took the following steps:
      1. The Docker client contacted the Docker daemon.
      2. The Docker daemon pulled the "hello-world" image from the Docker Hub.
         (amd64)
      3. The Docker daemon created a new container from that image which runs the
         executable that produces the output you are currently reading.
       4. The Docker daemon streamed that output to the Docker client, which sent it
          to your terminal.

     To try something more ambitious, you can run an Ubuntu container with:
       $ docker run -it ubuntu bashrjarnold/learning_docker:first_image_online

     Share images, automate workflows, and more with a free Docker ID:
       https://hub.docker.com/

     For more examples and ideas, visit:
       https://docs.docker.com/get-started/
     ```
- Listed docker images `sudo docker image ls`, and it came up with the hello-world image that came with the download. The instructions didn't include the sudo but without it I get the error `Got permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket`. As far as I can tell this issue isn't unique to me or the borrowed computer I'm using. Believe I need `sudo` in front of all my docker commands.
- Ran the hello world using `sudo docker run hello-world` and got the welcome message again but nothing else happened as far as I can tell, which may be what's supposed to happen.
- Made a new directory (docker-practice) and cd into in.rjarnold/learning_docker:first_image_online
- Made a file called app.py which contained
  ```
  from flask import Flask
  from redis import Redis, RedisError
  import os
  import socket

  # Connect to Redis
  redis = Redis(host="redis", db=0, socket_connect_timeout=2, socket_timeout=2)

  app = Flask(__name__)

  @app.route("/")
  def hello():
      try:
          visits = redis.incr("counter")
      except RedisError:
          visits = "<i>cannot connect to Redis, counter disabled</i>"

      html = "<h3>Hello {name}!</h3>" \
             "<b>Hostname:</b> {hostname}<br/>" \
             "<b>Visits:</b> {visits}"
      return html.format(name=os.getenv("NAME", "world"), hostname=socket.gethostname(), visits=visits)

  if __name__ == "__main__":
      app.run(host='0.0.0.0', port=80)
  ```
- Made a file called requirements.txt that just read
  ```
  Flask
  Redis
  ```
- Created a file called `Dockerfile` containing
  ```
  # Use an official Python runtime as a parent image
  FROM python:2.7-slim

  # Set the working directory to /app
  WORKDIR /app

  # Copy the current directory contents into the container at /app
  COPY . /app

  # Install any needed packages specified in requirements.txt
  RUN pip install --trusted-host pypi.python.org -r requirements.txt

  # Make port 80 available to the world outside this container
  EXPOSE 80

  # Define environment variable
  ENV NAME World

  # Run app.py when the container launches
  CMD ["python", "app.py"]
  ```
- Then built the docker image and called it "friendlyhello" using `sudo docker build --tag=friendlyhello .`.
- Did `docker image ls` and the firndlyhello image was listed along with hello-world
- Ran the docker image using `sudo docker run -p 4000:80 friendlyhello`, the `-p 4000:80` says to map the container's port (which is 80 as seet in the docker file) to my manchine's 4000 port. As a result when I go to "http://localhost:4000/" on a web browser I get a hello world message, and a note that it couldn't connect to Redis.
- In the terminal used ctrl+C to end the app and get back to the command line.
- Can run the app in the background from the get go by adding a `-d` before the `-p`. 
- Did that then ran `sudo docker container ls` to get a list of active containers which showed that one with a container ID which looks like a git SHA.
- Did `sudo docker container stop the_SHA_like_thing` and the container stopped, so I no longer got the message I got before at "http://localhost:4000/", and when I ls the containers there's none because there's none running.
- Redid it using port 3000 instead of 4000 and it worked fine, so 4000 isn't special.
- Now onto publishing and sharing dockerfiles. Made an account on [https://hub.docker.com/](https://hub.docker.com/).
- Logged into docker via my terminal using `sudo docker login`
- "The notation for associating a local image with a repository on a registry is username/repository:tag. The tag is optional, but recommended, since it is the mechanism that registries use to give Docker images a version." Did `sudo docker tag friendlyhello rjarnold/learning_docker:first_image_online`
- Pushed the image to my account online by `sudo docker tag push rjarnold/learning_docker:first_image_online`
- Refreshed the webpage with my account, the repository had been automatically create and the image placed within it.
- Now try running the image on another machine. On another ubuntu machine I tried running `sudo docker run -p 4000:80 rjarnold/learning_docker:first_image_online` Failed because docker wasn't installed on that machine. 
- Installed docker on that machine and tried again. It regonised the image wasn't on my local machine and downloaded it
- Went to "http://localhost:4000/" and the message was there as expected, so success. It had run without making the directory and files on my machine.
- Now looking at [this](https://geohackweek.github.io/Introductory/docker-tutorial_temp/) tutorial **Creative Commons Attribution 3.0 Unported**
- If I then run `docker run -i -t geohackweek2016/arraystutorial` then that image runs. The `-i -t` means that once I hit enter then I get a prefix "root@SHA_type_thing" in the terminal which I can then do standard linux commands with within the container. After experimenting with my own images find generally need `/bin/bash` at the end of this command on order to get the terminal as well as the `-i -t`. Not 100% sure why it wasn't needed for this example, maybe something in the dockerfile. Yeah. If you have `CMD ["/bin/bash"]` in the dockerfile then you don't need to have it when you run the container.
- When I do `ls` I see the stuff in the continer which is comletly different to the directory I ran the image in.
- Move a file from my computer into the container using 
  ```
  sudo docker cp file_name Sha_or_name_of_container:path_to_pyt_file/file_name
  ```
- Created a file inside the container, want to get it out, ran
  ```
  sudo docker cp Sha_or_name_of_container:path_to_pyt_file/file_name .
  ```
  The full stop meant the file was put where the terminal I was writing in was located. Note for the copying in/out of the container I ran the commands from outside the container, hence needing the sha to point to it.

- A docker file can look like this:
  ```
  FROM centos:7
  MAINTAINER spli@dundee.ac.uk

  RUN yum install -y -q epel-release
  RUN yum install -y -q python-pip
  RUN pip install omego
  ```
  where
    - FROM: The name of a base image
    - MAINTAINER: The email of the developer or owner
    - RUN: Runs a shell command
  and some other commonly used docker commands are:
    - COPY: Copies a file (e.g. a script, configuration file, or archive) into the Docker image
    - USER: Change the user that a command is run as (useful for dropping privileges)
    - WORKDIR: Change the current working directory
    - EXPOSE: Lists ports that should be exposed to the outside world
    - VOLUMES: Directories that should be managed separately from the container (e.g. persistent data that should be kept after the container exits)
- If you do some work in a container, close it, then open a new container from the image your work will be gone because it's building from the start 
- If you need to do work in a container and save it you can make a "volume" where it'll save the work so even if you close the container when you next make one from that image it'll still have your work. Do this by
  ```
  sudo docker run -i -t --mount source=my_volume_name,target=/notebooks image_name
  ```
  where the target is the directory in the container you're doing work in you want it to save. Then closed and restarted using the same command and my work was still there.
- Volume related commands:
  - List volumes: docker volume ls
  - Delete a volume: docker volume rm VOLUME-NAME
  - Delete all unattached volumes: docker volume prune
- Looking at [this](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/docker/docker_images.htm) tutorial (not open I don't think)
- To remove an image do `sudo docker rmi image_name_or_sha`
- There's docker kill, stop, pause, and unpause. Pause suspends processes running in the container, stop terminates them, kill is for terminating them when you don't case about being graceful about it. There's also restart which restarts after a stop. The syntax for using any of these is `sudo docker what_you_want_to_do container_ID`. Use exit to get out of the interactive bash shell if you started one.
- use `sudo docker rm container_ID` to remove a container. If you include a -v after the rm then it will also remove anny accociated volumes.
- Short example of a docker file
  ```
  #This is a sample Image 
  FROM ubuntu 
  MAINTAINER demousr@gmail.com 

  RUN apt-get update 
  RUN apt-get install –y nginx
  ADD my_local_file .
  CMD [“echo”,”Image created”] 
  ```
  Breaking this down:
  - Comments by #'s like python.
  - You need some kind of from statement oven if it's `FROM SCRATCH`. 
  - MAINTAINER self explanatory and not necessary to include.
  - RUN instructions to run when building the image
  - ADD is used if you have files on your computer you want to be put into the image. The syntax is the path to the file from where you're building the image in, and then the location in the container directory system you want the file to be placed. Note that you can only add files from the level or below where your dockerfile is. Pushed that image to DockerHub and then pulled it to a different computer. When I ran the contianer on that computer the file was in it.
  - CMD is commands to run when your container starts up. So to calify RUN are things you do to *setting up* a container from an image, and CMD is for commands to be automatically run in the container as soon as it's set up. The message only appears if I don't have interactive terminal. Not clear on why.
- It's good practice to use CMD for anything that is going to need to be run before someone starts working in the container. You *can* just follow the instreuction to run the container with a command (e.g `docker run containerID echo Imange created`)  and it'll have the same impact, but then you're relying on whoever is trying to run the container to know they need to follow that up with the command required. Putting it in the Dockerfile means it'll always be run.  
- There's ENTRYPOINT, but seems like bad practice to use, so leaving it out.
- Made directories within the container, but when I try using run to cd in and then making another directory within. Didn't work. Asked, this is because each RUN saves and deletes the previous container, then makes a new one from that point, does its run thing, then saves and is deleted and so on. Each layer is like a commit. As a result my RUNing cd into the directory doesn't matter because the next RUN statement restarts the container fresh so the next mkdir goes into the top level. According to David and Will I can use && to have multiple commands on one RUN, but when I try it it doesn't work. 
- There's COPY as well as ADD. Serves same function but ADD can also be used to add things from e.g. urls. At least in the one article I read they say it's best to use COPY since it's more explicit. Tested that copy could do the copying local files to an image thing the way add did and it suceeded.

[What are containers](https://opensource.com/resources/what-are-linux-containers?intcmp=7016000000127cYAAQ) **CC BY-SA 4.0**

Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. And they are designed to make it easier to provide a consistent experience as developers and system administrators move code from development environments into production in a fast and replicable way.

In a way, containers behave like a virtual machine. To the outside world, they can look like their own complete system. But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, containers don't need to replicate an entire operating system, only the individual components they need in order to operate. This gives a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application.

Undoubtedly, one of the biggest reasons for recent interest in container technology has been the Docker open source project, a command line tool that made creating and working with containers easy for developers and sysadmins alike, similar to the way Vagrant made it easier for developers to explore virtual machines easily.

Docker is a command-line tool for programmatically defining the contents of a Linux container in code, which can then be versioned, reproduced, shared, and modified easily just as if it were the source code to a program.

Containers have also sparked an interest in microservice architecture, a design pattern for developing applications in which complex applications are broken down into smaller, composable pieces which work together. Each component is developed separately, and the application is then simply the sum of its constituent components. Each piece, or service, can live inside of a container, and can be scaled independently of the rest of the application as the need arises.

Simply putting your applications into containers probably won't create a phenomenal shift in the way your organization operates unless you also change how you deploy and manage those containers. One popular system for managing and organizing Linux containers is Kubernetes. 

Kubernetes is an open source system for managing clusters of containers. To do this, it provides tools for deploying applications, scaling those application as needed, managing changes to existing containerized applications, and helps you optimize the use of the underlying hardware beneath your containers. It is designed to be extensible, as well as fault-tolerant by allowing application components to restart and move across systems as needed.

[What is docker](https://opensource.com/resources/what-docker) **CC BY-SA 4.0**

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.

In a way, Docker is a bit like a virtual machine. But unlike a virtual machine, rather than creating a whole virtual operating system, Docker allows applications to use the same Linux kernel as the system that they're running on and only requires applications be shipped with things not already running on the host computer. This gives a significant performance boost and reduces the size of the application.

For developers, it means that they can focus on writing code without worrying about the system that it will ultimately be running on.


[Paper presenting singularity](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0177459) **CC0 1.0 Universal (CC0 1.0)**

The advent of virtual machines [4, 5] introduced the exciting reality than an entire environment, including software dependencies, libraries, runtime code, and data, could be encapsulated and run anywhere. Virtual machines, however, also introduced large computational overhead due to the required level of virtualization for emulating the OS and kernel. With the addition of lightweight virtualization features to the Linux kernel (e.g., namespaces) a new lightweight virtualization, containers [15, 16], became possible to implement. Implementations such as Docker, one of the container solutions made open source in 2013 [15, 16], offered additional improvements over standard virtual machines. Containers could share resources
with the host without incurring much of the performance penalties of hardware-level virtualization [17].

Researchers can develop reproducible containers on their local machines, providing a simple way to collaborate on code or applications without the hassle of having different software versions or broken dependencies. Containers are ideal not just for the final analysis, but for the development of it. A user is most comfortable working with his or her text editor, programs, and environment of choice, and containers make it possible to work locally and develop in a specific environment simultaneously.

If you need to work with HPC containers save having to install a whole bunch of stuff on the cluster before you can, and installing may not even be possible if you need to download form the interenet.

Portability is essential for replication of the work, and so any product that is limited to where it can be deployed is instantly limited in the extent that it can be reproduced.

One of the major factors that prevents Docker from being the standard container technology in HPC is its security concerns. From an IT security perspective, a machine can be considered compromised if any user is able to run arbitrary code as the root user. While Docker takes steps to mitigate the risk of allowing users to run arbitrary code, there is a fatal design
flaw that limits Docker’s ability to run in HPC environments: for every container that Docker runs, the container process is spawned as a child of a root owned Docker daemon. As the user is able to directly interact with and control the Docker daemon, it is theoretically possible to coerce the daemon process into granting the users escalated privileges. Any user being able to escalate up to system administrator status, a user called “root”, would introduce unthinkable security risks for a shared compute environment.

**Mobility of compute.** Mobility of compute is defined as the ability to define, create, and maintain a workflow locally while remaining confident that the workflow can be executed elsewhere. In essence, mobility of compute means being able to contain the entire software stack, from data files up through the library stack, and reliability move it from system to system. Mobility of compute is an essential building block for reproducible science, and consistent and continuous deployment of applications.

An academic researcher wants to develop an analysis locally, meaning using a particular operating system, set of software, and library of functions, to work with some data to produce a particular output. The researcher then needs to be able to take that analysis, and move it to a different infrastructure. The researcher then would like to publish and distribute the entire contained analysis and its corresponding hash alongside the results of the research, allowing others to easily reproduce and validate the results.

## Material from hack.md

Main points to cover:
- What is a comutational environment (very brief)
- Why your computational environment (often kind of an afterthought) is actually really important for reproducibility.
- Local computational environments
    - Python `virtualenv` and `venv`, `conda` environments
    - Equivalent for R
- Containers
    - What they are
    - When you would use one locally (as not everyone will need to, depends on complexity of project)
    - How they are used in Binder
    - How they can be used for CI (but CI itself in different chapter)

requirements.txt say install e.g. matplotlib
Breaks because don't have the right version of matplotlib
install packages that require specific versions of other packages, dependancies.
Containers etc. Docker is/like a yaml file

We have a tendency to say we used "python" or "numpy" or "R" for our work, but actually there are different versions of these programming languages and packages which mean things are DIFFERENT across them.

One of the most common problems is coming back to your work after 6 months (maybe after reviewers have finally sent your paper back for revisions, or when you're about to fly off to the conference you applied for ages ago) and realising that your code doesn't work any more! Or maybe it does work but it gives you different answers.

* Need an example of errors from different packages.
  Could be a good crowd sourcing option - ask folks to tell us about their Gotchas!

Need a section on semantic versioning: https://semver.org.
Difference between major, minor and patch upgrades, commonly named as: MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH

It's actually really easy to capture your computational environment:

* `pip freeze`
* equivalent command for `conda`: `conda env export`
* equiv for `R`


As always prevention is better than a cure!
If you can install the specific version at the time of running and not up date it.

Useful to have different environments for different projects so that they don't go out of date! https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html

What's great about binder is that it will do all this for you\* - but we recommend that you specifically name the version of

\* Need to be v. careful about phrasing here - repo owner needs to provide info

ation on the computational environment, even if hidden from Binder user.

[Syntax for yaml files, think this resource is open source, and it's hosted on github](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/reference_appendices/YAMLSyntax.html)

Yaml's a markup language.

Ultimately Dockerfiles & Travis.yml files do similar things. They define computational environments.

Note the points from this blog post: http://urssi.us/blog/2018/12/21/why-research-software-sustainability-wont-be-fixed-by-containers/

YAML is very standard for configuration files.
It's used for Rmarkdown configurations, at the top of jekyll files and for conda configurations for example.

Indentation important:
- [YAML IDIOSYNCRASIES](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/troubleshooting/yaml_idiosyncrasies.html)
- [UNDERSTANDING YAML](https://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/topics/yaml/)

Makefiles

- older option to make things reproducible
- see issue https://github.com/alan-turing-institute/the-turing-way/issues/24
- PHONY will keep track of files created when you run this and not recreate already existing files

## Material from binder.md
Step 1: capture your python environment

https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#exporting-the-environment-file

https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/reference/pip_freeze/

`conda env export > environment.yml`

Note that you have to be IN this environment to run the command above.

or create the environment.yml file manually somehow

https://conda.io/docs/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html#creating-an-environment-from-an-environment-yml-file

Binder only supports 2.7.15 for a `requirements.txt` file.

Sarah personally recommends using the conda environment because it allows you to say which python installation you want too.

Binder has tons of examples to capture non-python examples but they are difficult to find:

https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_files.html
https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/sample_repos.html

Note - the `install.R` file is a made up file to install R packages. The standard way of doing this for R users is to use a DESCRIPTION file.

https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_files.html#install-r-install-an-r-rstudio-environment
https://mybinder.readthedocs.io/en/latest/config_files.html#description-install-an-r-package

Note that the DESCRIPTION file doesn't just install the specific package - it will ALSO install any requirements that you have :smile:


Step 2: go to mybinder.org, add your GitHub repo link (specify more when needed) and hit "launch"

Note: the default binder page opens up into a jupyter **notebook** server. It may be the case that the BETTER solution is to add `?urlpath=lab` to the end of the url so that it opens up a jupyter **lab** environment instead.

Note: difference between lab and notebook environment will (may) need to be covered in computing environment chapter (if we have time!)!

By default python 2 and python 3 are installed.

Jupyter lab allows you to open a *terminal* rather than a notebook.

The terminal doesn't have access to a GUI so importing matplotlib.pyplot or .pylab (graphical stuff) won't work

Q: what's the difference between a console and a terminal?

The console has enough for you to be able to run a bunch of python commands.

The terminal doesn't have access to a graphics card! So the console won't work.

Step 3: copy markdown back into your readme to get a nice "launch binder" button

**CHANGES IN BINDER ARE NOT PUSHED BACK INTO YOUR REPO/DOCKER!**

-> this is technically possible but not a feature offered by the public binder; it can be enabled on a local BinderHub (with some new )



![binder_comic](../figures/binder_comic.png)

## BinderHub

- needs Kubernetes cluster that spins up a bunch of VMs with containers etc. - also does some loadbalancing (Kubernetes [Google developed] being rather new and complex but it can be wrangled to do what you want it to do)
- jupyterLab to create the environments
- repo2docker that grabs repo from GitHub and launches Docker
- BinderHub basically is the high level coordinator for these 3 things and can be accessed through some frontend (the pyblic one being mybinder.org)


Also make this useful to run on local machines/HPCs (that might not be setup for this much networking) to enable data throughput independent of cloud availability
- you don't need all the fancy stuff Kubernetes can do to run a BinderHub -> strip down Kubernetes to the essentials and run that locally

Docker is a tool designed to make it easier to create, deploy, and run applications by using containers. Containers allow a developer to package up an application with all of the parts it needs, such as libraries and other dependencies, and ship it all out as one package. By doing so, thanks to the container, the developer can rest assured that the application will run on any other Linux machine regardless of any customized settings that machine might have that could differ from the machine used for writing and testing the code.

Docker is a tool that is designed to benefit both developers and system administrators, making it a part of many DevOps (developers + operations) toolchains. For developers, it means that they can focus on writing code without worrying about the system that it will ultimately be running on. It also allows them to get a head start by using one of thousands of programs already designed to run in a Docker container as a part of their application. For operations staff, Docker gives flexibility and potentially reduces the number of systems needed because of its small footprint and lower overhead.

Docker brings security to applications running in a shared environment, but containers by themselves are not an alternative to taking proper security measures.

Dan Walsh, a computer security leader best known for his work on SELinux, gives his [perspective](https://opensource.com/business/14/7/docker-security-selinux) on the importance of making sure Docker containers are secure. He also provides a [detailed breakdown](https://opensource.com/business/14/9/security-for-docker) of security features currently within Docker, and how they function.

Woes of development can be:

keeping a consistent environment while iterating through new builds
documenting so others can use your code like you already know how to
installing dependent software without conflicting with host versions
consistent testing environment
accountable data and traceable storage
Woes of operations can be:

proper documentation of the software being monitored
process micro-management and resource quotas
network configuration for application requirements
accountable data and traceable storage
By having a standardized image format, development sees all servers the same and operations sees all containers the same. These are the woes that Docker directly addresses. It is first necessary to distinguish the use of "image" and "container" within the Docker environment.

An image
Portable: They can be pushed to a registry, or saved as a tar archive.

Layered: The steps in producing an image, are added in layers. In this way, images that are mostly the same, except for the last few steps, can reduce disk usage by sharing parent layers.

Static: The contents are not changeable, unless making a new image.

A container
Runtime: An environment for PIDs.

Writable: It is essentially an ephemeral storage.

Layered: It is on an image.

These terms will show up in various contexts, and it is important to see how they relate to each other, but are also their own entities. With this foundation it's time to explore its basic Docker application and capabilities.
